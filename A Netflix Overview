### Project Overview

### Introduction
Netflix, Inc., although started in 1997, did not gain so much popularity until a decade later. This data set speaks to how the now popularly used streaming site has evolved over the years, from just a film hosting platform to the most engaged hub for movies and tv shows. 


### Task

### Findings

➢ “Film” in this analysis represents a combination of Movies (one-off film productions), and TV 
Shows (a series of film productions) 
➢ Movies make up 69% of Netflix’s total film collection, with the remaining 31% being TV shows 
➢ Choice of Movies/TV Shows added by Netflix to their platform are mostly those recently 
released (> 2010) 
➢ 7,788 films have been added to the Netflix platform between 2008 – 2020, 98% of which were 
added in the last 5yrs of the review period 
➢ Although the data was not sufficient to determine user engagement with the site and films 
onboarded, the spike in additions observed in early 2020 could be attributable to the upsurge 
in user engagements during this period. The 2020 Covid lockdown, as well as the increase in 
the amount of time spent indoors might have partly contributed to this. 
➢ About one-third of the films added have come from the United States, with India and the U.K 
coming in second and third place 
➢ Even though film feature per cast member stands at an average 1.14, David Attenborough 
appears to be Netflix’s most sort after Actor, featuring in 18 film productions so far (5 Movies 
& 13 TV Shows) 
➢ Of the Top 10 Directors with the most movies directed, only Marcus Raboy was seen to have 
a mix of Movies & TV Shows in his portfolio 
➢ Marcus is also one renowned for having a substantial number of film productions under his 
belt (16), falling short of the chart leader – Raul Campos, Jan Suter – by two films. 
➢ Two African countries, Egypt (101 Films) and Nigeria (70 films), made it to the top 20 most 
featured locations 
➢ Film produced in countries like Nigeria, Brazil, Egypt, etc., did not gain recognition on Netflix 
until 2015
