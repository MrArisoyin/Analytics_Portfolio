# Predictive Modelling

This project aims to develop a predictive model that will help a Portuguese bank optimize its resources by targeting individuals who are more likely to subscribe to a new line of products it intends to introduce.

* The task is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether an individual will likely subscribe to a new product.
* The extracted dataset contains 17 variables of anonymized customer data, categorized into; Customer Data (1-8), Contact Data (9-12), Contact Summary Data (13-16), Result (17)
* Algorithms/methods used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression.
* The forecasts will be assessed using measures of forecast evaluation such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* The full dataset is described and analyzed in S. Moro, P. Cortez, and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems (2014), doi:10.1016/j.dss.2014.03.001
